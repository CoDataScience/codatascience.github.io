* Was a graduate student at Princeton with David Blei.
* Was a postdoc and then professor in Maryland's Computational Linguistics and Information Processing lab. 
* Research focuses on making machine learning more useful, more interpretable, and able to learn and interact from humans. This helps users sift through decades of documents; discover when individuals lie, reframe, or change the topic in a conversation; or to compete against humans in games that are based in natural language.
