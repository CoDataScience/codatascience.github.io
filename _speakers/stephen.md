* Was a Herman Goldstine Postdoctoral fellow in Mathematical Sciences at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, NY
* Was a postdoctoral fellow via the Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de Paris at Paris 6 (JLL lab) with Patrick Combettes, and co-advised by Volkan Cevher (EPFL) 
* Interested in information extraction from various types of datasets. Specific topics of research includes
	* Optimization: first-order methods, quasi-Newton methods, primal-dual algorithms, convex analysis
	* Numerical linear algebra: randomization and its interplay with optimization methods
	* Sampling theory: how to make the best use of your resources when confronted with big data
	* Mathematical applications: compressed sensing and variants, matrix completion and variants (robust PCA…), non-negative matrix factorization and end-member detection, sparse SVM
	* Physical applications: radar ADC using compressed sensing, quantum tomography, MRI, medical imaging, IMRT, renewable energy, big-data
