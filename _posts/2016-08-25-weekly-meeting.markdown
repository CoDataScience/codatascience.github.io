## Agenda

* [Adam Bloniarz](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~adam/), now of Google Boulder, talked to the team about using convolutional neural networks to answer problems in computational neuroscience. He also gave a general overview of what it is like to do data science at Google.
* Team member Daniel Korytina presented on using AdaBoost to give better "off-the-shelf" regression performance compared to various linear model-based regressors.
